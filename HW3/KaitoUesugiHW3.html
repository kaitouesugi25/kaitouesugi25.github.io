                    “The human eye can only be in one place at a time, it takes its visible world with it as it walks. With the invention of the camera, everything changed. We could see things which were not there in front of us. Appearances could travel across the world.” - John Berger

                    Paintings prior would exist only within a single space, but now have the ability to exist separately from its original physical context. While there is an argument that this reproduction dilutes the physical existence of artwork, this same act of reproduction can give a greater perpetually evolving context to the image itself.

                <h2>Context behind Image</h2>
                <p>
                    Berger emphasizes the importance of examining the cultural context behind images. From advertisements to fine art, there lies intent and strategy behind the production of imagery. Consuming these vast amounts of visual information can change the perception/behavior of a viewer. The theme of conceptually finding the "next step" within the way images evolve by examining patterns that come up in history is brought up a couple times in "Ways of Seeing EP1" by Berger.
